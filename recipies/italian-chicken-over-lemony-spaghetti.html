  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>
    A wonderfuly creamy and zesty dish featuring italian-spiced chicken, browned zucchini, and 
    spaghetti coated in a cheesy lemon-insufed sauce.
  </p>
  <h3>Ingredients (2 servings)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 zucchini</li>
    <li>1 clove garlic (but go ahead and use more)</li>
    <li>1 lemon</li>
    <li>~1 lbs chicken</li>
    <li>1 tbsp italian seasoning</li>
    <li>1 tsp chili flakes</li>
    <li>1 tbsp chicken stock concentrate</li>
    <li>2 tbsp sour cream</li>
    <li>1/4 cup parmesean cheese, finely grated</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Directions</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      While bringing a large pot of water to a boil, wash and dry all produce. Trim zucchini lengthwise, and cut 
      crosswise into 1/2" pieces. Peel and mince garlic. Zest and quarter lemon.
    </li>
    <li>
      Once water is boiling, add spaghetti to pot (make sure to salt your pasta water!). Cook until al denta, 9-11 minutes. 
      Reserve 1 cup pasta water for sauce, and drain the rest. Keep empty pot handy for further steps.
    </li>
    <li>
      While pasta cooks, heat a drizzle of oil in a skillet, preferably nonstick, on med-high heat. 
      Add zucchini and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned and soft, ~4-6 minutes. Season with salt and pepper 
      to taste. Turn off heat and transfer to plate; wipe out pan.
    </li>
    <li>
      While zucchini cooks, pat chicken dry with paper towel and season all over with italian seasoning. When zucchini is done, 
      heat another large drizzle of oil over med-high heat and add chicken. Cook 3-5 minutes per side until cooked through. 
      Turn off heat and transfer to a cutting board to rest; once cool, slice crosswise into strips.
    </li>
    <li>
      Heat a drizzle of oil in pot used for spaghetti, again over med-high heat. Add garlic and half of lemon zest, and a pinch of chili flakes. 
      Cook while stirring until fragrant, ~30 seconds. Stir in 1/2 cup of the pasta water from earlier, along with the stock concentrate and 
      juice from two lemon quarters. Simmer 1-2 minutes until thickened, and turn off heat.
    </li>
    <li>While warm, add the drained spaghetti, zucchini, sour cream, and 1 tbsp butter to sauce in pot; toss noddles to coat. 
      Add half the parmesean cheese, and further splashes of pasta water if needed to help thicken sauce to a creamy 
      consistency. Divide pasta, and top with chicken, chili flakes, lemon zest, and remaining parmesean cheese. 
      Serve with lemon wedges on the side.
    </li>
  </ol>
